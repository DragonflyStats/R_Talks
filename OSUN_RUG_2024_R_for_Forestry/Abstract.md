the use of the R programming language in the commercial forestry industry:

Abstract: The field of forestry research has significantly benefited from the integration of computational tools and statistical methods in recent years. Among these tools, the programming language R has emerged as a powerful and versatile platform for forestry research, encompassing data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

### Abstract:

The R programming language has become a powerful tool in forestry research, enabling data analysis, modeling, and visualization. 

By leveraging R's statistical capabilities, forestry professionals can gain valuable insights for sustainable forest management and resource utilization. Join us to discover how R contributes to evidence-based decision-making in forestry science.

In this presentation, we explore how R is transforming the commercial forestry sector. We'll explore some key R packages commonly used by researchers, such as vegan, lme4, nlme, MuMIn, and ggplot2.

### Application Areas

R has found numerous applications in the field of forestry, aiding researchers and practitioners in data analysis, modeling, and decision-making. Here are some practical examples:

1. **Forest Inventory and Sampling**:
   - R is commonly used for forest inventory data analysis. Researchers can estimate tree volume, biomass, and species composition based on sample plots.
   - Statistical packages like `forestinventory` and `spatialEco` facilitate sampling design, stratification, and spatial analysisÂ¹.

2. **Growth Modeling**:
   - R allows fitting growth models to understand tree growth patterns over time. Researchers can use linear or nonlinear mixed-effects models to account for individual variability.
   - Packages like `nlme` and `lme4` are popular for modeling tree growth and predicting future stand dynamics.

3. **Spatial Interpolation and Mapping**:
   - R provides tools for spatial interpolation (e.g., kriging) to predict forest attributes across unsampled areas.
   - Packages like `gstat` and `automap` help create continuous maps of variables like tree height, volume, or species richness.

4. **Forest Health Assessment**:
   - R aids in analyzing forest health indicators, such as tree mortality rates, disease prevalence, and insect infestations.
   - Researchers can use statistical tests and visualization libraries (e.g., `ggplot2`) to explore patterns and trends.

5. **Forest Planning and Optimization**:
   - Linear programming and optimization techniques in R assist in forest estate planning. These methods optimize timber harvest schedules, considering ecological, economic, and social factors.
   - Packages like `lpSolve` and `ROI` are useful for forest management planning.

6. **Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)**:
   - SDM predicts species occurrence or abundance based on environmental variables. R packages like `dismo` and `biomod2` facilitate SDM using presence-absence data or species abundance data.

Remember that these examples merely scratch the surface of R's capabilities in forestry. 
Researchers continue to develop new packages and methods, making R an essential tool for sustainable forest management and research.

To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of R and R package usage frequencies across 14,800 research articles published in eight top forestry journals from 2013 to 2022. 
Notably, 45.7% of these articles explicitly utilized R as their primary tool for data analysis. 
The adoption of R exhibited a linear growth trend, rising from 28.3% in 2013 to 60.9% in 2022. 
The top five most used R packages were vegan, lme4, nlme, MuMIn, and ggplot2. 
Our findings underscore the pivotal role of R in enabling researchers to conduct thorough analyses and gain comprehensive insights into various aspects of forestry science1.
